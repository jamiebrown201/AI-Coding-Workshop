# Dashboard Project Workspace

This is your workspace for building the real-time engagement dashboard.

**Start from scratch!** There is no boilerplate provided. You'll build everything yourself with AI assistance.

---

## Your Challenge

Build a full-stack real-time engagement dashboard based on the requirements in [CHALLENGE.md](../CHALLENGE.md).

**What you're building:**
- Backend API (Express, Node.js, or your choice)
- Frontend dashboard (React, Vue, or your choice)
- Real-time data updates (polling, WebSocket, SSE - you decide)

---

## Getting Started

This folder is empty on purpose. You decide:

1. **Project structure** - How will you organize backend and frontend?
2. **Tech stack** - What frameworks/libraries will you use?
3. **Architecture** - How will components communicate?

**Use AI to help you:**
- Plan the architecture
- Set up the project structure
- Generate boilerplate
- Implement features
- Debug issues

**But remember:** You own the decisions. AI can suggest, but you choose.

## Suggested Workflow

### Step 1: Planning (20-30 min)

Before writing any code, decide:
- Backend structure (Express? Routes? Services?)
- Frontend structure (Components? Hooks? State management?)
- Real-time strategy (Polling vs WebSocket vs SSE?)
- API contract (What endpoints? What data shape?)

**Use AI for planning:** See [PROMPT_EXAMPLES.md](../PROMPT_EXAMPLES.md) for planning prompt ideas.

### Step 2: Backend (20-30 min)

Create your backend from scratch:
```bash
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
# Then use AI to help set up Express, routes, etc.
```

### Step 3: Frontend (30-40 min)

Create your frontend from scratch:
```bash
mkdir frontend
cd frontend
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
# Or use AI to help set up your preferred stack
```

### Step 4: Integration (15-20 min)

Connect backend and frontend, test end-to-end.

## Tips

### Don't overthink the stack
- Express + React is fine
- Don't need Redux/complex state management
- Start simple, add complexity if needed

### Use AI effectively
- Ask for architectural advice first
- Generate boilerplate structure
- Implement features incrementally
- Test as you go

### Remember the learning goals
- **Breaking down problems** - How do you split this into tasks?
- **Using AI at each step** - Plan → Build → Test → Debug
- **Making decisions** - AI suggests, you choose
- **Understanding vs speed** - Don't just copy/paste

---

## Expected Deliverables

By the end of the challenge, you should have:

- [ ] Working backend with mock data endpoints
- [ ] Frontend dashboard displaying metrics
- [ ] Real-time updates (some strategy implemented)
- [ ] Filtering functionality
- [ ] Clean code you understand

**You don't need:**
- Production-ready code
- Perfect architecture
- Full test coverage
- Deployment setup

## Need Help?

**If stuck on prompting:** Check [PROMPT_EXAMPLES.md](../PROMPT_EXAMPLES.md)

**If stuck on architecture:** Refer to [CHALLENGE.md](../CHALLENGE.md) for guidance

**If stuck on approach:** Ask your facilitator or discuss with your team

**Remember:** The goal is learning how to build with AI, not building the perfect dashboard. Focus on the process, not perfection.
