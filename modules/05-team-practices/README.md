# Module 5: Team Practices & Responsible Use

Moving beyond individual use, this module addresses the critical questions of integrating AI coding tools effectively and responsibly within a team. You'll explore how to establish guidelines, define code review standards for AI-assisted work, protect junior developer growth, and navigate the ethical considerations of AI. The goal here is to ensure AI adoption enhances, rather than compromises, your team's overall productivity and code quality.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- ✓ Create practical team guidelines for AI tool usage
- ✓ Define code review standards for AI-assisted work
- ✓ Establish security and compliance requirements
- ✓ Support junior developer learning with AI tools
- ✓ Measure the impact of AI tools on your team
- ✓ Balance productivity gains with responsible use

## Introduction/Scenario

**Core Question:** How do we adopt AI coding tools without compromising quality, security, and developer growth?

## Structure/Activities

- **Activity 5A: Create Team Guidelines**
- **Activity 5B: Responsible Use Discussion**
- **Activity 5C: Measuring Impact (Optional)**
- **Synthesis & Action Planning**

## Prerequisites

- Completed Modules 1-4
- Experienced the benefits AND limitations of AI tools
- Ready to think critically about adoption

## Getting Started

```bash
cd modules/05-team-practices
```

## Key Concepts

- **When to Use (and Not Use) AI Tools**
- **Code Review Standards for AI-assisted code**
- **Supporting Junior Developers**
- **Security & Compliance**
- **Transparency About AI Usage**

## Success Criteria

- [ ] You have drafted practical team guidelines for AI tool usage.
- [ ] You can articulate the key challenges and trade-offs of using AI in a team.
- [ ] You have a plan for how to measure the impact of AI tools on your team.
- [ ] You have committed to specific practices to improve your use of AI tools.

## Common Pitfalls

- **"AI generates bad code"**
- **"Juniors aren't learning"**
- **"Security vulnerabilities increasing"**
- **"Code quality decreasing"**
- **"Inconsistent patterns"**
