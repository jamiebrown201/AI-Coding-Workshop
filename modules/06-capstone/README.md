# Module 6: Capstone Challenge - The "Wild & Wonderful" AI-Powered Feature

This is it! The Capstone Challenge is your opportunity to synthesize everything you've learned and build something creative, fun, or interesting. Under time pressure, you'll build a complete, production-ready feature, applying your skills in AI-assisted development, security, testing, and documentation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- ✓ Apply all the skills and concepts from the previous modules in a single challenge.
- ✓ Build a complete full-stack feature.
- ✓ Make trade-offs between functionality, security, and quality.
- ✓ Present your work and explain your technical decisions.

## Introduction/Scenario

**The Final Challenge:** You've learned the fundamentals, explored codebases, built features, reviewed for security, and discussed team practices. Now it's time to have some fun and build something creative.

**Your Mission:** Build a "Wild & Wonderful" AI-powered feature. It can be silly, it can be interesting, it can be anything you want. The only rule is that it has to be a complete, working feature.

## Inspiration Ideas

- **"Passive Aggressive Commit Message Generator"** - Enter what you did, get a commit message dripping with sarcasm
- **"Code Roast Bot"** - Upload your code, get destroyed by an AI comedian
- **"Meeting Could've Been An Email Detector"** - Paste meeting notes, find out if it was actually necessary
- **"Jargon Bullshit Meter"** - Scores corporate buzzword nonsense levels
- **"CSS Speedrun"** - Race to recreate a design. Leaderboard included.
- **"Regex Golf"** - Shortest regex wins. Lose friendships.
- **"AI That Argues With You"** - Takes the opposite position on everything
- **"The Most Overengineered Todo App"** - Microservices, event sourcing, CQRS. For a todo list.
- **"Git Blame Poetry Slam"** - Your git history as dramatic spoken word
- **"Worst Possible Implementation"** - Solves problems in the most inefficient way possible

**Or build literally anything else. Make it weird.**

## Prize Categories

At the end of the workshop, we'll award prizes in the following categories:

- 🏆 **Silliest Idea** - The most absurd, ridiculous, or hilariously pointless feature
- ✨ **Slickest Execution** - The most polished, professional, and well-crafted implementation
- 🤯 **Most Overengineered** - The feature that uses the most unnecessary technology for the simplest problem
- 🎨 **Most Creative** - The most original, unexpected, or innovative concept
- 🔥 **Actually Useful** - The feature someone would genuinely want to use in production
- 😱 **Best Use of AI** - Demonstrated the most effective AI-assisted development workflow

**Everyone demos. Everyone votes.**

## Structure/Activities

- **Checkpoint 1: Backend Working**
- **Checkpoint 2: Full Integration**
- **Checkpoint 3: Polish & Security**
- **Checkpoint 4: Demo Time!**

## Prerequisites

- Completed Modules 1-5
- Your AI tool ready to go

## Getting Started

```bash
cd modules/06-capstone
npm install
```

## Key Concepts

- **Working Approach:** Choose a strategy (Feature-First, Layer-First, Critical Path).
- **Using AI Effectively:** Generate code, but you make the decisions.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Functionality, Security, Code Quality, Testing, Documentation.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] You have built a working, secure, and maintainable feature.
- [ ] You can demo your feature and explain your technical decisions.
- [ ] You can identify what worked well with AI and what didn't work so well.
- [ ] You know what you would add or improve if you had more time.

## Common Pitfalls

- **"I'll perfect one part first"**
- **"Security later"**
- **"AI will handle complexity"**
- **"Tests at the end"**

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality (30%):** Does it work as expected?
- **Security (25%):** Did you run the security checklist and address any issues?
- **Testing (20%):** Does the feature have a reasonable level of test coverage?
- **Documentation (15%):** Is the feature well-documented?
- **Creativity & Fun (10%):** How creative, fun, or interesting is the feature?

## Next Steps

After the workshop:

1. Review your code against the reference solution
2. Complete anything you didn't finish
3. Apply these practices in your daily work
4. Share learnings with your team
5. Draft team guidelines
6. Measure your actual productivity gains

## Reflection Questions

After completing the capstone:

1. **What went well?**
2. **What was harder than expected?**
3. **How did AI help?**
4. **Where did AI struggle?**
5. **What would you do differently?**
6. **Are you ready to use AI tools in production?**
7. **What will you change about how you work?**

## Group Discussion

- How did working with AI affect your decision-making process when it came to using the AI and verifying its output?
- After completing this entire workshop, what is your biggest remaining concern about the widespread use of AI coding assistants in the software industry?

## Key Takeaways

**Good luck! You've got this. 🚀**
