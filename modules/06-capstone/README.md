# Module 6: Capstone Challenge

**Duration:** 60 minutes

This is it! The Capstone Challenge is your opportunity to synthesize everything you've learned throughout the workshop. Under time pressure, you'll build a complete, production-ready feature, applying your skills in AI-assisted development, security, testing, and documentation. This final challenge is designed to simulate real-world constraints and trade-offs, solidifying your understanding of how to effectively and responsibly leverage AI coding tools from start to finish.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- ✓ Apply all the skills and concepts from the previous modules in a single challenge.
- ✓ Build a complete full-stack feature under time pressure.
- ✓ Make trade-offs between functionality, security, and quality.
- ✓ Present your work and explain your technical decisions.

## Introduction/Scenario

**The Final Challenge:** You've learned the fundamentals, explored codebases, built features, reviewed for security, and discussed team practices. Now it's time to put it all together.

**Product Context:**
```
As an FT editorial team member
I want to see trending topics based on reader engagement
So that I can make informed decisions about content promotion
```

## Structure/Activities

- **Checkpoint 1 (20 min): Backend Working**
- **Checkpoint 2 (40 min): Full Integration**
- **Checkpoint 3 (55 min): Polish & Security**

## Prerequisites

- Completed Modules 1-5
- Your AI tool ready to go

## Getting Started

```bash
cd modules/06-capstone
npm install
```

## Key Concepts

- **Working Approach:** Choose a strategy (Feature-First, Layer-First, Critical Path).
- **Using AI Effectively:** Generate code, but you make the decisions.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Functionality, Security, Code Quality, Testing, Documentation.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] You have built a working, secure, and maintainable feature.
- [ ] You can demo your feature and explain your technical decisions.
- [ ] You have a clear understanding of what you would do differently next time.

## Common Pitfalls

- **"I'll perfect one part first"**
- **"Security later"**
- **"AI will handle complexity"**
- **"Tests at the end"**

## Resources

- [Security Checklist](../../docs/security-checklist.md)

## Next Steps

After the workshop:
1. Review your code against the reference solution
2. Complete anything you didn't finish
3. Apply these practices in your daily work
4. Share learnings with your team
5. Draft team guidelines
6. Measure your actual productivity gains
