# Self-Paced Learning Guide

**Using the AI Coding Workshop Materials Independently**

## Welcome, Solo Learner!

This workshop was designed for in-person sessions, but all materials work perfectly for self-paced learning. You'll miss the energy of the room and peer learning, but you'll gain the ability to go at your own pace and dive deeper where you're interested.

## How to Use These Materials

### Time Commitment

**Full workshop:** 6-7 hours (spread over multiple sessions recommended)

**Suggested schedule:**
- **Session 1 (2 hours):** Module 1 - Foundations
- **Session 2 (1.5 hours):** Module 2 - Codebase Understanding
- **Session 3 (2 hours):** Module 3 - Full-Stack Features
- **Session 4 (1.5 hours):** Module 4 - Code Review & Security
- **Session 5 (1.5 hours):** Module 5 - Team Practices (adapt for solo)
- **Session 6 (1 hour):** Module 6 - Capstone

**Don't try to do it all in one day.** Your brain needs processing time.

### Prerequisites

Everything listed in [GETTING_STARTED.md](../GETTING_STARTED.md), plus:

**Self-directed learning skills:**
- Ability to stay focused without a facilitator
- Willingness to struggle through problems
- Comfort seeking help when stuck (online communities, docs)
- Self-accountability

## Module-by-Module Guide

### Module 1: Foundations & First Steps

**Solo adaptation:**
- ✅ Exercises work perfectly solo
- ✅ Check your work against solutions
- ⚠️ Missing: Peer comparison and discussion

**How to compensate:**
1. Do the exercises completely before checking solutions
2. Write down your reflections before reading the provided ones
3. Consider posting your solution to a community for feedback
4. Try explaining your approach out loud (rubber duck debugging)

**Time allocation:**
- Exercise 1A (Article Preview): 30-40 minutes
- Exercise 1B (Bug Hunt): 30-40 minutes
- Reading and reflection: 20 minutes

### Module 2: Codebase Understanding

**Solo adaptation:**
- ✅ Architecture exploration works solo
- ✅ Refactoring planning is individual work
- ⚠️ Missing: Gallery walk and peer insights

**How to compensate:**
1. Draw your architecture diagram on paper first
2. Then create a digital version
3. Compare with reference architecture
4. Challenge your own assumptions: "What did I miss?"
5. Look for three different ways to structure the solution

**Time allocation:**
- Architecture analysis: 30-40 minutes
- Refactoring planning: 30-40 minutes
- Reading and comparison: 15 minutes

### Module 3: Full-Stack Features

**Solo adaptation:**
- ✅ Building exercise works solo
- ⚠️ Missing: Team dynamics, peer review, demo showcase

**How to compensate:**
1. Set a strict 75-minute timer
2. Force yourself to plan before coding
3. Do a self-demo: explain your work to an imaginary audience
4. Record yourself explaining it (seriously, try this!)
5. Review your recording: Did you communicate clearly?

**Time allocation:**
- Planning: 10 minutes (don't skip this!)
- Building: 60 minutes
- Self-review: 20 minutes

### Module 4: Code Review & Security

**Solo adaptation:**
- ✅ Security review exercise works perfectly solo
- ✅ Refactoring challenge is individual
- ⚠️ Missing: Competitive element, peer discussion

**How to compensate:**
1. Track your score on the security challenge
2. Time yourself
3. Try to beat your own record on a second pass (tomorrow)
4. For each vulnerability, write down why it's dangerous
5. Research real-world exploits of each type

**Time allocation:**
- Security review: 25-30 minutes
- Refactoring challenge: 25-30 minutes
- Research and learning: 20 minutes

### Module 5: Team Practices

**Solo adaptation:**
- ⚠️ Designed for group discussion
- ✅ Guidelines exercise still valuable
- ⚠️ Fishbowl discussion doesn't translate well

**How to adapt:**
1. **Skip the fishbowl discussion** - read the topics instead
2. **Create personal guidelines** for your own AI usage
3. **Write reflection answers** to discussion questions
4. **Draft team guidelines** for your actual team (if applicable)
5. **Journal about ethical considerations**

**Alternative:** Find an online community or colleague to discuss with

**Time allocation:**
- Reading and reflection: 30 minutes
- Creating guidelines: 30 minutes
- Optional: Online discussion if you find a group

### Module 6: Capstone Challenge

**Solo adaptation:**
- ✅ Works perfectly solo
- ⚠️ Missing: Demo pressure, competitive energy

**How to compensate:**
1. Set a strict 60-minute timer
2. Work against the clock
3. Record a 3-minute demo video for yourself
4. Watch it tomorrow: Is it clear?
5. Pretend you're presenting to your team

**Time allocation:**
- Building: 60 minutes (strict!)
- Self-demo recording: 10 minutes
- Reflection: 10 minutes

## Solo Learning Strategies

### Create Accountability

**Option 1: Social accountability**
- Tweet your progress
- Blog about what you learned
- Post in coding communities
- Find a learning buddy online

**Option 2: Self accountability**
- Keep a learning journal
- Set completion goals
- Reward yourself for finishing modules
- Track time and progress

### Simulate Collaboration

**Techniques:**
1. **Rubber duck debugging** - Explain your code to an inanimate object
2. **Record yourself** - Present your work on camera
3. **Write it out** - Document as if teaching someone
4. **Challenge yourself** - "What would a code reviewer ask?"

### Avoid Solo Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Going too fast**
- Temptation: Skip exercises, just read
- Fix: Do ALL exercises, even when you "get it"

**Pitfall 2: No breaks**
- Temptation: Power through all modules
- Fix: Take 10-minute breaks between modules

**Pitfall 3: No reflection**
- Temptation: Jump to next exercise immediately
- Fix: Write down 3 takeaways before moving on

**Pitfall 4: Looking at solutions too early**
- Temptation: Check solution when stuck
- Fix: Struggle for 20 minutes first

**Pitfall 5: Isolation**
- Temptation: Never ask for help
- Fix: Use online communities, Stack Overflow, forums

### When to Get Help

**Stuck on setup?**
- Read [GETTING_STARTED.md](../GETTING_STARTED.md) troubleshooting
- Search GitHub issues
- Ask in online communities

**Stuck on an exercise?**
- Re-read the requirements
- Check the hints
- Struggle for at least 20 minutes
- Then check solutions or ask for help

**Conceptual confusion?**
- Read the docs thoroughly
- Search for external resources
- Ask AI to explain (but don't just copy)
- Online communities are friendly!

## Final Thoughts

**Solo learning is hard but rewarding.**

You won't have the energy of a live workshop, but you'll have deeper control over your learning. Take your time. Struggle with the exercises. Ask for help when needed. And most importantly: **actually do the work.**

Reading about AI coding tools isn't the same as using them. **Ship code. Make mistakes. Learn.**
