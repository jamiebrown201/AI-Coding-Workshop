# 🤖 AI Coding Workshop: Learn to Pair Program with Robots (Sort Of)

Welcome! You're about to spend a day learning how to work with AI coding assistants without losing your mind, your job, or your ability to think critically. This repository contains everything you need to become dangerously competent with AI tools.

## Prerequisites

**You should have:**
- A laptop (phones won't cut it, sorry)
- An AI coding tool installed (Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- Git (you're a developer, you have this)
- Node.js 18+ (we're not animals)
- A healthy dose of skepticism (essential)
- Coffee/tea (not required but highly recommended)

**You don't need:**
- Expert-level skills in anything
- Prior AI tool experience (that's what we're teaching!)
- AWS expertise (we'll guide you through it)
- Perfect understanding of everything (that's why you're here)

## Quick Start

Run this magical command:

```bash
./scripts/verify-setup.sh
```

If everything's green, you're golden. If not, see [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for troubleshooting, or just ask someone nearby. We're friendly.

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is organized into six modules, each building on the previous:

1. **[Foundations & First Steps](modules/01-foundations/)** - Get started with AI-assisted coding
2. **[Understanding Codebases](modules/02-codebase-understanding/)** - Use AI to explore legacy systems
3. **[Full-Stack Features](modules/03-full-stack/)** - Build complete features with AI help
4. **[Code Review & Security](modules/04-code-review/)** - Maintain quality and catch vulnerabilities
5. **[Team Practices](modules/05-team-practices/)** - Adopt AI tools responsibly
6. **[Capstone Challenge](modules/06-capstone/)** - Put it all together

## Working on Your Own?

This workshop is designed for in-person sessions but works perfectly for self-paced learning. Check out [docs/self-paced-guide.md](docs/self-paced-guide.md) for guidance on working through the materials independently.

## Key Documents

- **[Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - Setup and installation
- **[Security Checklist](docs/security-checklist.md)** - Your new best friend
- **[Prompting Guide](docs/prompting-guide.md)** - How to talk to AI effectively
- **[Anti-Patterns](docs/anti-patterns.md)** - What NOT to do (learn from others' mistakes)
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)** - For when things go sideways

## Philosophy

This workshop is built on a few core beliefs:

- **AI tools are just tools** - They're not magic, and they're not replacing you
- **Skepticism is healthy** - Question everything, including what AI suggests
- **Context matters more than prompts** - Giving AI the *right* information beats clever wording
- **Understanding > Speed** - Fast code you don't understand is a liability
- **Security is non-negotiable** - AI makes mistakes; you catch them

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:
- ✅ Use AI tools effectively for specific tasks
- ✅ Review AI-generated code critically
- ✅ Avoid common security pitfalls
- ✅ Work with AI within team standards
- ✅ Know when to trust AI and when to question it
- ✅ Measure the actual impact of AI tools on your work

## What You Won't Learn

This isn't about:
- ❌ Blindly trusting AI to write your code
- ❌ Replacing your thinking with prompts
- ❌ Getting rich quick with AI (sorry)
- ❌ Becoming an "AI expert" overnight
