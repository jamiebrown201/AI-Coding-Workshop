## Quick Start for Different Users

### **Participant:**
```bash
cd ai-assistant-workshop
npm run verify
# Then start with modules/01-foundations/README.md
```

### **Facilitator:**
```bash
cd ai-assistant-workshop
# Read WORKSHOP_FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md
# Test all exercises yourself first
# Prepare materials listed in guide
```

### **Self-Learner:**
```bash
cd ai-assistant-workshop

```

## File Counts

**Documentation:** 15+ comprehensive guides
**Code Examples:** 10+ working code files
**Exercises:** 6 major hands-on activities
**Solutions:** Complete solutions for all exercises
**Scripts:** 2 utility scripts

## Testing Status

**Verified Working:**
- ✅ Setup verification script runs
- ✅ Security scan script runs
- ✅ File structure is complete
- ✅ All READMEs have proper formatting
- ✅ Code examples are syntactically valid

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Run through Module 1 exercises yourself
- Test security scan on vulnerable code
- Verify setup script catches common issues
- Do a dry run of the full workshop

## Known Gaps (Intentional)

These are starter templates that participants/facilitators complete:

**Module Exercise Starters:**
- Some exercises provide starter code intentionally incomplete
- Participants fill in implementations
- Solutions provided for reference

**Configuration:**
- Real API keys should be added via environment variables
- Database connections need actual credentials
- These are intentionally not hardcoded

**Advanced Features (Optional Extensions):**
- Additional fixture data can be generated
- More exercises can be added
- Tool-specific examples can be added

## Maintenance Notes

**Update Frequency:** Quarterly recommended
- AI tools evolve rapidly
- Best practices change
- New security issues emerge

**What to Update:**
- Tool versions in package.json
- AI tool examples (Claude Code, Copilot updates)
- Security vulnerability patterns
- Exercise difficulty based on feedback

## Contribution Opportunities

**Good First Contributions:**
